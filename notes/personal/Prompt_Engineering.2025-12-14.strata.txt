Prompt Engineering: Strata

   A prompt does not summon a deterministic function. It perturbs a
 probabilistic field that already has gradients. Recency effects, system-level
 adjustments,  hidden state resets, sampling noise, model updates, even your
 own wording choices that feel identical but aren't. Expecting identical outputs
 across time is like expecting the same cloud twice because you stood in the
 same field. It should be considered normal that prompt quality varies day to
 day and session to session.

   Think of the system as stratified. At the bottom are tectonic plates: 
 training distribution, architecture, alignment constraints. You don't touch
 these. Above that are prevailing currents: system prompts, project files,
 recent conversation history. These shift slowly. Then come local weather
 patterns: your phrasing, tone, examples, the immediate conversational 
 momentum. That's where butterflies live. That's where chaos feels personal.

 Most people confuse weather noise with climate change.

 Developing taste is learning to ask:
 "Did this fail because the atmosphere was turbulent, or because my structure
  was weak?"

   A good prompt doesn't eliminate variance. It 'damps' it. It narrows the
 distribution so that even bad days are acceptable and good days are excellent.
 A brittle prompt produces brilliance once and nonsense twice. A mature prompt
 produces usefulness almost always and insight occasionally.

 If a prompt only works when the air is still, it isn't finished.
 If it works across turbulence, it's becoming infrastructure.

   The chaos doesn't go away. You learn which layers you're actually influencing
 and which ones you should stop arguing with. That's not resignation. That's
 seamanship. At that point, variance stops feeling like betrayal and starts
 feeling like signal.
