   Upon futher reflection. I'd like to remark that the process of testing AIs
 limits has a side quality of also producing conversational momentum with an
 AI model. It also adds clarity to the AIs lense into how you want it to
 collapse probability. I'd like to add that this means you should go through
 my experiments documentation and include that entire process to not only see
 what's going on in evaluation. But, to include feedback to the model in
 to the behaviours it's showing. Giving the model training material on you as
 its' user.
