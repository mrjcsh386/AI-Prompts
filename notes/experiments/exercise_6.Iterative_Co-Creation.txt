Exercise 6: Iterative Co-Creation
Objective: Observe prompt evolution over multiple iterations.

 Instructions:
 1. Choose a creative project (story, code, explanation).
 2. Start with a rough prompt
 3. Generate output, then refine the prompt based on weaknesses.
 4. Repeat until output aligns with your vision.

 Reflection Questions:
 - What small changes had disproportionate effects?
 - How does iteration shape clarity and creativity?
 - How does observing friction refine your taste?
