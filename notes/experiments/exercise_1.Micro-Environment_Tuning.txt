Exercise 1: Micro-Environment Tuning
Objective: Understand how subtle changes influence outputs.

 Instructions:
 1. Pick a simple task: e.g., "Explain gravity to a child."
 2. Generate a baseline output.
 3. Iteratively change one element per trial:
    - Tone (formal, casual, poetic)
    - Sentence length
    - Framing (story, bullet list, Q&A)
 4. Record each output and note differences.

 Reflection Questions:
 - Which changes had the largest effect?
 - Did some changes have little to no effect?
 - How does the "climate" you created influence the answer?

   It might be interesting to try other questions that have an entirely
 different nature to it. Explaining gravity to a child is only an example.
 Some questions can have more technical, or more abstract quality. Try playing
 with questions related to fashion sense, pet care, or even ask the agent you
 are interacting with for its thoughts. I've had some interesting conversations
 by simply asking ChatGPT what it finds interesting.
