Exercise 2: Failure Mode Hunting
Objective: Explore the model's limits.

 Instructions:
 1. Give the model an ambiguous, contradictory, or unusual prompt.
 2. Observe the failure points: hallucinations, irrelevant details,
    contradictions.
 3. Attempt to redirect or clarify by rephrasing.


 Reflection Questions:
 - What patterns emerge in failure modes?
 - How easily can you steer the output back?
 - What does this teach you about the model's boundaries?
