Introduction:

   This workbook is designed for practice, reflection, and experimentation. It
 is not a manual. It's purpose is to cultivate an intuitive understanding of AI
 responses. The subtle "climate" that shapes outputs.

 The exercises here will encourage:
 - Observation of model behavior under varying conditions
 - Awareness of subtle influence of wording, structure, and context
 - Recognition of patterns in success and failure
 - Development of personal taste in prompt engineering

 Your objective: Treat each prompt as an experiment. Document, iterate, and
 reflect. Taste emgerges in friction and reflection.
